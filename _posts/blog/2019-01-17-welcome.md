Hello, I'm Sören Köhler and this is my newest iteration in blogs. It shall in the first place be a landing page to my humble coding projects. Further I'll occasionally write down some thoughts (or rants) about life, the universe and everything else.

### Why another one? Don't you already have pages on Wordpress, Smugmug, Google+, ...? What about Facebook?

- Facebook is, well, Facebook. The internet's equivalent of a crowded pub: Always good for some funny smalltalk and cat pictures, not so for deeper thought.

- Google+ would have been fine, wouldn't it be in progress of [shut down](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google%2B#Shutdown_of_consumer_version) in the near future.

- Wordpress was a long-time home. Same: Smugmug for my photos. But with the advent of the EU-GDPR, I cancelled both services to wait and watch how the new regulation would play out in the long.

### And now?

Since most of my publishing would concern things I've hosted on Github, I tried Github Pages. It does exactly what I need: Takes text files in a git repo, transforms them into plain, fast HTML, no plugins, no ads, very few attack vectors for hackers and lawyers. Also, I prefer Markdown over the WYSIWYG-approach of Wordpress.
