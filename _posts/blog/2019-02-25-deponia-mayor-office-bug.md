When I discovered, that there's a 4th part (although already three years old,
somehow missed it back then) of the [Deponia-series](
    https://www.daedalic.com/deponia
){:target="_blank"}, I immediately began to replay the first three parts so I
could continue fresh into the last one.

### But Stop

...either my memory was not so accurate or I did stumble across a bug as soon as
in the earliest part of the first game. In detail: I could not enter the mayors
office. Movement arrow showed up, but Rufus simply did not enter the room. Old
save games did not help either. In desperation I even consulted some guides, but
according to those: all requisites were met. I concluded that I possibly did
find a Win10-related bug. I will not speculate if Win10 is the main reason or
the game-code, but I will give a...

### Workaround

When I frustrated began to click wildly, assuming somehow differing areas for
triggering the arrow and the actual transition or some intersection with the
Wenzel-sprite in front, suddenly Rufus entered the office. But without
transition animation. I left the mayors office and rechecked:
* single click = no transition,
* double click = transition into new room.

### Collateral discovery

A double click skips the transition animation and may speed up gameplay when
entering a door far away. Plus it may skip some bugs.
