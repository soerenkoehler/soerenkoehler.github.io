For some days the tech media are full of reports regarding "Operation
ShadowHammer":

As the headline implies: This is why I'm paranoid enough to set up a new PC
without internet. I use another computer to download/provide tools like
[Sysinternals Autoruns](
    https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/sysinternals-suite
){:target="_blank"}, [Winaero Tweaker](
    https://winaero.com
){:target="_blank"}, etc. ... Then shut off every piece of bloatware that your
OEM may have installed. Last time, I reconnected too early to the internet and
instantly some OEM-driver kicked in and a dozen bloatware windows opened. It's
annoying enough that Win10 without tweaking behaves like adware. But if someone
messes around with my device(s), then I'd prefer it to be the OS manufacturer
alone, not everyone else...
