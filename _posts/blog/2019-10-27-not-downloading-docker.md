title: (Not) Downloading Docker Desktop...

Today I had some spare time and remembered that I wanted to check on Docker for
Windows. It was not trivial to find the download link and if you find it, it
will redirect you to the Docker Hub login page. A web search quickly led to this
[Issue in Github](
    https://github.com/docker/docker.github.io/issues/6910
){:target="_blank"}.

Obviously, Docker Inc. hides even the community edition behind some login
wall. Dear Docker Inc.: Although the screenshot promises it to be free, I
have to pay with my data and wasting lifetime managing another unnecessary
account.

Seems no surprise, that the plea of the community is ignored already over one year.

Conclusion: Until there is a real free download, I'll will have an eye on the
alternatives.
