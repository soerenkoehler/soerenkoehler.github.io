Every once in a while I wonder, if there's something better than Google Calendar
to track my todos. Some days ago, I was again browsing through the depths of
todo and list management services. And: as you might expect - I found nothing.
In most cases, one or another feature was premium only or completely missing.
Often the workflow was not less awkward as with Calendar. And so I'm still fine
with Google Calendar, organizing my todos with a set of calendars aka projects
and colors for tagging/labeling. Even Google's own companion apps "Tasks" and
"Keep" don't integrate seemlessly with my calendar workflow.

Google could merge Calendar/Task/Keep to a useful Planning app if they would
allow sub events, simple workflow tags (open, in progress, done) and/or
checklists in event body. And if you are on it, Google, please reduce the number
of clicks necessary in Android to do simply tasks like moving a event (e.g.
long-press to directly edit the event). And I'd like it very much if the month
view could scroll vertical by week, to have a better view on month boundaries.
