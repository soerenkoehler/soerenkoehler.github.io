title: WSL2 is now Running

Another long break since my last try with WSL2. Back then, I couldn't get WSL2
to access the network. The possible culprit was possibly the HyperV-system in
general. At that time, I had VirtualBox running, Windows Sandbox and then WSL2.
And maybe I did activate the wrong HyperV components.

After I had to re-setup my system some days ago, I could now start with a (more
or less) clean system. Thus, my current analysis/theorie is the following:

*   HyperV installs virtual network switches. Some are plainly visible in the
    device manager control panel. Others, I learned, are hidden devices. You can
    view/delete them _before_ installing WSL2 using the menu entry "View/Show
    hidden devices".

*   Don't guess the necessary HyperV components. If you find yourself fiddling
    around with HyperV settings then something already went wrong. Simply follow
    the official [installation guide][guide].
