title: Go requires GCC
tags: [english, dev, golang]

While moving my development environments to WSL2 I stumbled over a strange but
obviously known bug: Although the go compiler `go build` itself does not depend
on GCC, under Linux `go test` may abort for not finding GCC in `$PATH`. As far
as I saw in the issues

*    [#27303][issue1]
*    [#33840][issue2]

this behaviour was introduced shortly after Go 1.11 and it is obviously still
not fixed in Go 1.15. The comments at Github advice to change the environment
variables CGO_ENABLED and/or GO111MODULE. Since I did not have luck with that I
resorted to the cheapest workaround: _simply install GCC_. Sometime it may have
additional use beside fixing `go test`.
