Some days ago I did finished the first release of ChDiff, the commandline tool for creating, verifying and comparing checksums on file trees. It supports sha256, sha512 - and in case you need it: md5 and size. Currently the checksum functionality (create, verify and diff) is quite stable. The backup operations are still under construction. And so is the manual...

You can download the release on [https://github.com/soerenkoehler/checksum-diff/](https://github.com/soerenkoehler/checksum-diff/releases)
