When starting with the Go language I soon realized, that I have some
requirements when building and releasing packages on Github:

*   local and CI builds from the same tool
*   multi platform builds
*   automatic latest release
*   manually triggered tagged releases
*   creating zip and tgz archives depending on target platform

Instead of learning also Typescript and build a normal Github Action I have
implemented the above in a little Go tool that runs as part of a Github
workflow. For further information and instructions see:
