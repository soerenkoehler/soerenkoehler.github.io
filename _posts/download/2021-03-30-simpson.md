### Update v0.1.5 ###
The new versions
[v0.1.5](
    https://github.com/soerenkoehler/simpson/tree/v0.1.5
){:target="_blank"}
adds automatic creation of SHA256 digest and some small improvements in the CLI handling.

### Background ###

When starting with the Go language I soon realized, that I have some regular
requirements when building and releasing packages on Github:

* local and CI builds from the same tool
* multi platform builds
* automatic latest release
* manually triggered tagged releases
* creating zip and tgz archives depending on target platform
* create SHA256 digests

For further information and instructions see the [Simpson Github-Repo](repo){:target="_blank"}
