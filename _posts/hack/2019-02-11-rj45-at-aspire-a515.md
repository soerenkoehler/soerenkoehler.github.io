### Not really a hack
...but an advice.

The Acer Aspire A515 is quite thin, so there's not enough room for a full
height RJ45-port. For this reason the Aspire 5 has a low-profile LAN-port with
a hinged lid. I did not expect this to be some problem. But it became one
just when I tried to plug in the LAN-cable. WTF? The connector won't fit?
Even with the lid down? Are there different variants of RJ45-plugs?
Something like "slim LAN cables"?

Advice part 1: When googling, you may find references to an adapter for a
combined LAN/VGA-port. False trace, at least for my A5-version. The engraving
besides the port clearly and only states: LAN-port. Further, that adapter
would have been in the packaging. Rechecked: nothing left.

Advice part 2: After some minutes of probing and trying I found the solution.
You can very, very carefully find an angle where the plug fits without
resistance. I cannot describe the detailed parameters. As Master Yoda says:
"Feel yourself the force you must."
